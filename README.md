# PokemonGo-Model
A probabilistic model for Pokemon Go
I tried to model the world famous Pokemon Go game in matlab in terms of probability.
As you are aware of the game where the accuracy of your throw improves the chances of catching the Pokemon.
And also feeding the pokemon and throwing a curvy ball enhances the chances of catching the pokemon.
Also remember the fact that Pokemon may flee away sometimes if it doesnt like you.
Enjoy!
